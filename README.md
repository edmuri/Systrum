A new interactive way to create spotify playlists! Just put in a sentence that you want to represent and our application will map out each word to a song for you to listen to on a new playlist! Discover new songs by inputting creative outlandish sentences, or create a message to send out to your friends!

This was inspired by the twitter trend of indirect messages through your playlists! Our team decided to automate this process and allow for a new way to discover songs! Keep an eye on the repo for a link to our deployed site!
